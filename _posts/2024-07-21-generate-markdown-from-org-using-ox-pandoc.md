title: Generate Markdown from org-mode file using ox-pandoc
---

## Background

This blog site is generated by Jekyll and rendered beautifully using the
[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme. I\'m
pretty happy with it, but I feel sometimes rather hesitant, to add more
posts. I did not have this feeling years ago when I only use markdown to
write posts.

It comes from the fear of repeating myself: I am writing all my private
notes in [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/). This format is powered by
Emacs and have rich features in addition to markdown. On the other hand,
while Jekyll can recognize org-mode with the help of
[`jekyll-org`](https://github.com/eggcaker/jekyll-org), markdown is
still its favorite format. Before finding a good exporter, I have to
copy the file, manually do the conversion from org-mode to markdown, and
repeat it whenever I update the original note. This is a boring labor
and does not add to my knowledge.

This fear, if not the underlying laziness[^1], has been holding me from
publishing more posts here. Now, eventually, I find myself unable to
stand it any more and face it directly.

## In the market

I am definitely not the only one with this problem. Searching the
Internet gives me a few available approaches:

1.  `ox-md`: built-in markdown exporter. With a quick try, I found that
    it failed to export the `#+title` property correctly. It does not
    write ```` ``` ```` style code block either, making the syntax
    highlighter in Jekyll useless.
2.  `ox-gfm`: exporter for GitHub favored markdown, derived from
    `ox-md`. It can correctly export ```` ``` ```` code block, but still
    does not export the title.
3.  `ox-html`: also a built-in exporter but directly to HTML. This is a
    fundamental way to publish org-mode contents online, and has been
    used to connect org-mode and Jekyll as described in [this official
    tutorial](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html).
    However, it seems rather cumbersome to take advantage of the Chirpy
    theme when posts are directly written in HTML.
4.  `ox-hugo`: a markdown exporter oriented to the Hugo system. This
    exporter is oriented to Hugo, and it assumes the file hierarchy in
    Hugo. For example, markdown posts have to be exported under the
    `content` directory.
5.  `ox-pandoc`: wrapper around the wonderful universal converter
    [pandoc](https://pandoc.org). It correctly handles title and code
    blocks when exporting markdown. It also supports reading the
    metadata of org file like `#+title`, `#+date`.

`ox-pandoc` turns out to suit the best for my needs.

## Installation

To use `ox-pandoc`, `pandoc` should of course be discoverable in the
executable paths, and then include `ox-pandoc` in Emacs configuration.
The latter is almost one-liner in Doom Emacs: simply switching on the
pandoc plugin of the org module in `init.el`

``` elisp
(doom! :lang
       (org +pandoc))
```

Decent defaults have already been configured, so it is not necessary to
add more codes to `config.el`. If bibliography is needed, `citeproc-el`
package should be installed and loaded.

``` elisp
;; in package.el
(package! citeproc)

;; in config.el
(use-package! citeproc)
```

## Writing and configuration

### Pandoc options

pandoc command line options can be customized by `#+PANDOC_OPTIONS` in
the org-mode header.

For example, heading level of markdown posts in Jekyll starts from 2,
but it usually starts from 1 in org-mode. Therefore it should be
promoted by 1 when exporting to markdown for Jekyll. For the built-in
markdown exporter, there is exactly a variable for this purpose
`org-md-toplevel-hlevel` (also `org-html-toplevel-hlevel` in HTML
exporter), but `ox-pandoc` does not acknowledge it. Instead, we need to
parse the `--shift-heading-level-by` command line option of pandoc

    #+PANDOC_OPTIONS: shift-heading-level-by:1

### Pandoc metadata

Metadata, such as category and tags, have to be parsed to pandoc by
`#+PANDOC_METADATA` option. Different entries can be specified in
multiple `#+PANDOC_METADATA` lines.

    #+PANDOC_METADATA: categories:tool
    #+PANDOC_METADATA: "tags:Emacs org-mode pandoc ox-pandoc"

This will results in the YAML header

``` markdown
---
categories: tool
tags: Emacs org-mode pandoc ox-pandoc
---
```

This is already handy, though it would be nice if `ox-pandoc` can
recognize `#+filetags`.

Note that single tag with space is needed, it is necessary to parse an
empty tag,

    #+PANDOC_METADATA: "tags:First tag" tags: "tags:Second tag"

will generate

``` markdown
---
tags:
- First tag
-
- Second tag
---
```

The empty flag is fine as it will be ignored by Jekyll.

### Liquid template

Simple liquid filter can be used by wrapping it with markdown raw code,
`@@markdown:@@`. For example,
`@@markdown:site.time | date_to_xmlschema@@` (double curl brace
neglected, otherwise it will be rendered as liquid) gives:
{{ site.time | date_to_xmlschema }}.

### Internal links

Direct internal link such as `[[Internal links]]` works in org-mode, but
would be exported to something like `[4.4](#Internal links)` by
`ox-pandoc` at the time of writing. A workaround is to use the explicit
anchor `[[#internal-links][Internal links]]`, leading to [Internal
links](#internal-links). To make it also work within org-mode, a custom
id is required

    ** Internal links
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: internal-links
    :END:

The custom ID is not exported for the `gfm` writer. Therefore if the
custom ID is not the same as the one generated by Jekyll, the link will
fail. A partial solution is to use the general `markdown` writer.
Nevertheless the `markdown` writer has its own issues in this case and I
will addressed it [later](#markdown-flavor).

### Equations

Typing equations is simple. In org-mode it is not required to add
surrounding `$$` for a display math equation.

``` latex
\begin{equation}\label{eq:euler}
\begin{aligned}
e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
```

which is rendered as

$$\begin{equation}\label{eq:euler}
\begin{aligned}
e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}$$

It is possible in org-mode to cross-reference the equation by
`eqref:eq:euler` using [org-ref](https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref).
Unfortunately it is neither acknowledged by markdown nor converted to
the correct `$\eqref{eq:euler}$` syntax by `ox-pandoc`.

The conversion can be done by using a pandoc filter (thanks to ChatGPT)

``` lua
-- Pandoc filter to replace strings starting with 'eqref:' with Math nodes
-- In JSON AST, from
--   {"t":"Str","c":"eqref:eq:xxx"}
-- to
--   {"t":"Math","c":[{"t":"InlineMath"},"\\eqref{eq:euler}"]}
--
-- Trailing punctuation are handled.
function Str(el)
  local prefix = "eqref:"
  local content = el.text
  if content:sub(1, #prefix) == prefix then
    local eqref_content = content:sub(#prefix + 1)
    local main_content, punctuation = eqref_content:match("^(.-)([%p%s]*)$")
    local math_node = pandoc.Math('InlineMath', '\\eqref{' .. main_content .. '}')

    if punctuation ~= "" then
      return {math_node, pandoc.Str(punctuation)}
    else
      return math_node
    end
  end

  return el
end
```

Save the filter somewhere and add it to the pandoc options

    #+pandoc_options: lua-filter:convert_org_ref_eqref.lua

Then org-ref equation link should work: $\eqref{eq:euler}$.

### Citation and Bibliography

`ox-pandoc` is aware of org-cite-style citation link, for example,
`[cite:@PerdewJ96PBE]`, and can render it into markdown-type link before
it is parsed to pandoc using
[citeproc-el](https://github.com/andras-simonyi/citeproc-el). One just
needs to specify the bibliography file to look for the citation key with
`#+bibliography` and how the entry should be exported with
`#+cite_export`; see [this
section](https://github.com/emacsorphanage/ox-pandoc?tab=readme-ov-file#citations-and-bibliographies-experimental)
of `ox-pandoc`.

In my case, I have a `.bib` file and citation style file under `etc/`
directory, so I just need to add the following two lines in the heading

    #+bibliography: etc/bibliography.bib
    #+cite_export: csl etc/american-physics-society-without-titles.csl

When exported to markdown, `[cite:@PerdewJ96PBE]` is rendered as
`\[[1](#citeproc_bib_item_1)\]` and gives Â \[[1](#citeproc_bib_item_1)\]
on the Jekyll end. To print the bibliography, just insert the directive
`#+print_bibliography:` at the place where you want to put the list of
references. In this case, it is converted to markdown to

``` markdown
<span id="citeproc_bib_item_1"></span>\[1\] J. P. Perdew, K. Burke, and
M. Ernzerhof, Phys. Rev. Lett. **77**, 3865 (1996).
```

To make `ox-pandoc` also handle the org-ref link, we can work around by
converting the org-ref-style `cite:X` links to org-cite `[cite:@X]`.
This can be done using the following snippet:

``` elisp
(defun my/org-pandoc-convert-org-ref-link-to-org-cite (BACKEND &optional subtreep)
  "Hook function to convert org-ref cite link to org-cite cite link.

Currently it uses a naive implementation by `re-search-forward' for the conversion.
Caveats:
- only work with pandoc backend
- only handle cite and fullcite
- cannot handle notes"
  (if (not (equal BACKEND 'pandoc)) ()
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (re-search-forward
             "\\([=\~]\\)?\\[?\\[?\\(cite\\|fullcite\\):&?\\([^] @\t\r\n]+\\)\\]?\\]?\\([=\~]\\)?"
             nil t)
      ; do not convert those in a source code block or inline code
      (unless (or (org-in-src-block-p)
                  (string= (match-string 1) "=") (string= (match-string 1) "~")
                  (string= (match-string 4) "=") (string= (match-string 4) "~"))
        (let ((keys  ; handle multiple keys
                (replace-regexp-in-string "[,;]&?" ";@" (match-string 3))))
          (cl-case (intern (match-string 2))
                   (fullcite
                     (replace-match (format "[cite/bibentry/bare:@%s]" keys)))
                   (t
                     (replace-match (format "[\\2:@%s]" keys)))))))))

(add-to-list 'org-export-before-parsing-functions 'my/org-pandoc-convert-org-ref-link-to-org-cite)
```

Load and try to do the conversion:

-   `cite:PerdewJ96PBE`: Â \[[1](#citeproc_bib_item_1)\]
-   `cite:&PerdewJ96PBE`: Â \[[1](#citeproc_bib_item_1)\]
-   `[cite:&PerdewJ96PBE]`: Â \[[1](#citeproc_bib_item_1)\]
-   `=cite:PerdewJ96PBE=`: `cite:PerdewJ96PBE`
-   `~[cite:&PerdewJ96PBE]~`: `[cite:&PerdewJ96PBE]`
-   `fullcite:&PerdewJ96PBE`: J. P. Perdew, K. Burke, and M. Ernzerhof,
    Phys. Rev. Lett. **77**, 3865 (1996)
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.3865"
    target="_blank">[DOI]</a>.

For more about citation in org-mode, the nice series by William Denton
(the first article found
[here](https://www.miskatonic.org/2024/01/08/org-citations-basic/)) is
worth reading.

### Footnote

In org-mode footnote is written as

    Hello world![fn:hw]

    [fn:hw] this is a footnote

It will be rendered by pandoc in markdown as

``` markdown
Hello world![^1]

[^:1] this is a footnote
```

Note that there is [an issue](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/1603)
(also [here](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/224) opened by John
himself) in pandoc that footnote will be duplicated when referenced more
than once. A dirty workaround is to use the raw code `@@markdown:[^1]@@`
, leading to [^1]. You have to track the footnote number yourself since
pandoc always converts the raw footnote IDs to sequential numbers.

Citations in this case are not affected because normal markdown link is
generated by `citeproc-el` instead of footnote link.

### Chirpy prompt block quotes

Chirpy can render block quotes with `prompt-` class nicely. In Jekyll
markdown parser [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org), HTML
attributes of a block can be specified by adding `{:}` before or after
the element. For example,

    @@markdown:{:.prompt-tip name=my-first-tip}@@
    #+begin_quote
    This is a tip block.

    Another tip line.
    #+end_quote

is converted by pandoc to markdown as

``` markdown
{:.prompt-tip name=my-first-tip}

> This is a tip block.
>
> Another tip line.
```

and rendered by Jekyll into a prompt block

{:.prompt-tip}

> This is a tip block.
>
> Another tip line.

The block quote in HTML is
`<blockquote class="prompt-tip" name="my-first-tip">`. Apart from `tip`,
`info`, `warning` and `danger` are available.

{:.prompt-info}

> This is an info block.

{:.prompt-warning}

> This is a warning block.

{:.prompt-danger}

> This is a danger block.

### GitHub flavor (GFM) or other? {#markdown-flavor}

The GFM is widely used and `gfm` is a format specifically supported by
pandoc. But one issue I have is that `gfm` does not export the custom
identifier of heading when the custom ID is different from the heading
slug.

Good news is that the general `markdown` writer supports writing custom
ID as `# heading {#id}`. Bad news, however, is its own caveats:

-   org-mode heading are written as `RawBlock`
-   Tables are exported in a indented simple format.
-   The \"verbatim\" class, added to the `pandoc.Code` object when
    parsing inline verbatim (`=verb=`) to AST, is exported as
    `` `verb`{.verbatim} ``. Unfortunately, it cannot be rendered by
    kramdown, which expects `` `verb`{:.verbatim} ``.
-   Attributes of source code block will be exported as well, but
    kramdown fails to render it in a similar reason to the inline
    verbatim.

The last two are actually related to the way the `markdown` writer
writes the class and attributes for the object. Before a kramdown
variant of Markdown writer is implemented (reader discussed in
[pandoc#2711](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/2711)), some pandoc
filter will help on these issues.

``` lua
-- Remove RawBlock nodes like "#+export_file_name" in markdown export
function RawBlock (el)
  return {}
end

-- Remove verbatim class of inline code
function Code(c)
  local filter_verbatim = function(le)
    return le ~= "verbatim"
  end
  c.classes = c.classes:filter(filter_verbatim)
  return c
end

-- Remove uncessary attributes of code block to avoid render issue
function CodeBlock(c)
  c.attributes.eval = nil
  c.attributes.results = nil
  c.attributes.wrap = nil
  c.attributes.exports = nil
  return c
end
```

In cases where link attributes are required, we can keep them but export
the link in HTML format. This can be achieved by dropping the
`link_attributes` extension. Meanwhile, the issue about tables can be
solved by switching off the `simple_tables` extension. This can be done
with `ox-pandoc` by setting in the header

    #+pandoc_extensions: markdown-simple_tables-link_attributes

### Subtree export

It is possible to export a subtree of an org file and have own pandoc
options for each subtree. The options should go to the property drawer,
with `export_` prefix.

    * Title of my subtree
    :PROPERTIES:
    :export_file_name: ~/my_subtree_export
    :export_author: anonymous
    :export_options: toc:nil tags:nil title:t date:nil author:t
    :export_pandoc_options: shift-heading-level-by:1
    :export_pandoc_metadata: comments:true
    :export_pandoc_metadata+: categories:tool math:false
    :END:

Exporting the subtree either by `(org-pandoc-export-to-gfm nil t)` or
changing export scope to subtree by `C-s` in export dispatch, will
generate `~/my_subtree_export.md` as follows

``` markdown
---
author: anonymous
categories: tool
comments: true
math: false
title: Title of my subtree
---
```

This would be useful if notes are written in a single file but wants to
be published in a series of markdown posts. Note that multi-line options
and metadata have to be defined with the `<PROPERTY>+` syntax.
Otherwise, only the last line of the same property will be recognized.

## Batch export

Emacs can be run in batch mode, so that the conversion can be done
without opening Emacs GUI.

``` shell
emacs -Q -batch -load etc/common.el -load etc/jekyll.el \
        --eval '(setq enable-local-variables :all)' \
        --visit=generate-markdown-from-org-using-pandoc.org \
        -f org-pandoc-export-to-gfm --eval '(sleep-for 5)'
```

where `etc/common.el` defines org variables common to all org export
tasks, e.g. `user-full-name`, `user-mail-address`, as well as
`org-link-abbrev-alist` to decode link abbreviations. In
`etc/jekyll.el`, `ox-pandoc` and `citeproc-el` are loaded.

``` elisp
;; Use packages under doom directory
;; ox-pandoc
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/ox-pandoc")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/dash.el")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/ht.el")

;; citeproc-el
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/citeproc-el")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/queue")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/compat")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/s.el")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/f.el")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/parsebib")

(unless (executable-find "pandoc")
  (error "pandoc is not found"))

(require 'ox)
(require 'ox-pandoc)
(require 'citeproc)

(setq org-export-with-broken-links t)  ; t/'mark/nil
(add-to-list 'org-export-backends 'pandoc)

(setq org-pandoc-options
      '((standalone . t)
        (mathjax . t)
        (variable . "revealjs-url=https://revealjs.com")))
```

The final `(sleep-for 5)` command waits for the asynchronous `pandoc`
process triggered by `org-pandoc-export-to-gfm` (see
[ox-pandoc#6](https://github.com/emacsorphanage/ox-pandoc/issues/6)) to
finish. Otherwise it would be killed before the markdown is correctly
generated.

Batch export of subtree should possible but needs more tweak, which goes
beyond the scope of this note.

## Summary

With `pandoc` and `ox-pandoc` in Emacs, I can write my org-mode notes,
convert them to markdown and finally publish them on my Jekyll site,
without laborious manual changes. In fact, this post is written in this
way.
