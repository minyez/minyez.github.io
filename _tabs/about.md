Hi, my name is Min-Ye Zhang.
I'm currently a postdoctorate fellow at [Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://iop.cas.cn),
and now visiting [the NOMAD Laboratory](https://nomad.fhi.mpg.de/) at the Fritz Haber Institute of [Max Planck Society](https://www.mpg.de/en)
since February 2023.

I got my Ph. D. in Physical Chemistry from [College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn)
at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), advised by Professor [Hong Jiang](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/jianghgroup).
My current researches focus on the development and application of advanced electronic structure methods to facilitate
designs of functional materials.
