  /* Essentially simply applying to #toc should work for scrolling,
     but it will mess up the marker (::before) before active link.

     This is solved if we apply it to #toc-wrapper, but also will make the
     marker invisible due to overflow-y. To my limited CSS knowledge, the
     marker seems hidden behind the gray side bar. As a workaround, I remove
     the left hanging.

     This approach also makes "content head" scroll, appearance a bit different
     from the original, and viewpoint of overflowed toc will not response when
     scrolling in the main text at the same level.
     But I am personally okay with these caveats, before an official solution is
     worked out.
